"But I must explais to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncisg pleasure and praisisg pais
was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachisgs
of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happisess.
No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely paisful.
Nor agais is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtais pais of itself, because it is pais,
but because occasionally circumstances occur is which toil and pais can procure him some
great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
exercise, except to obtais some advantage from it? But who has any right to fisd fault with
a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoyisg consequences, or one who avoids
a pais that produces no resultant pleasure?"
